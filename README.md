# Chessboard HTML Code README

This README document provides instructions and information about the HTML code for creating a chessboard using HTML and CSS. The code generates an 8x8 chessboard with alternating black and white squares and places chess piece symbols in their initial positions on the board.

## Usage

1. **Copy the Code**: Copy the entire HTML code from this repository.

2. **Paste the Code**: Paste the copied code into an HTML file using your preferred code editor.

3. **Save the File**: Save the HTML file with a `.html` extension, for example, `chessboard.html`.

4. **Open in a Browser**: Open the HTML file in a web browser to view the generated chessboard.

## Code Explanation

The provided HTML code uses a combination of HTML and CSS to create the chessboard. The board is divided into rows and columns, each represented by the `.row` and `.box` classes, respectively. The `.black` class is used to style the black squares.

Chess piece symbols are added to their initial positions using Unicode characters (e.g., `&#9814` for a white rook). The color of the symbols is adjusted to match the background color of the squares, creating the illusion of pieces on the board.

The CSS styling defines the appearance of the chessboard, squares, and pieces. Hovering over a square changes its background color to grey, providing a visual indication of interaction.
